hi

i have started getting into minecraft modding with a friend of mine named Anubis, and before that, whilst learning Java,
these are the projects that i made

it starts off with a calculator, can include other stuff,  but we'll see.

this respitory is mostly used for a backup, but anyone is free to use if needed.
